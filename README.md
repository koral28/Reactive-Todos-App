Description:

In this project I wrote an application that allows the user to arrange his task
list. The user can create lists, each with its own distinct title and color and image. In
each list, the user may add todo items. Finally, the user may check an item to mark it
as completed.

Goals:

● Working with models and statefull services
● Using the router to navigate between pages
● Using router guards
● Using core, routing modules to better structure our application
● Using Reactive Forms and validation to edit objects
● Using Some advanced CSS layout
● Building Components to consume the services
● Using @Input and @Output in components
● Using CSS variables to reuse colors in our application
● Using an external package: material-icons to present cool icons
